**NOTE:** The current branch with the most recent changes is `reintegrate/master_into_indigo_devel`. We are slowly reducing the public support for this stack. It is mainly there for us to try quick demos and as an example of [libpointmatcher](https://github.com/ethz-asl/libpointmatcher) code.

This [ROS] stack provides a real-time 2D and 3D [ICP]-based SLAM system that
can fit a large variety of robots and application scenarios, without any code
change or recompilation.

Information about this stack, including installation and compilation, is available on the [ROS] wiki at [http://www.ros.org/wiki/ethzasl_icp_mapping](http://www.ros.org/wiki/ethzasl_icp_mapping).
